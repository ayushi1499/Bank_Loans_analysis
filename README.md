# Overview:
The project focuses on creating a comprehensive loan report and dashboard system to monitor and assess various key metrics related to the bank's lending activities. 

# Key Metrics:

  Total Loan Applications: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specific period.
  Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

# Total Funded Amount:

  Track the total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
  Analyze the MTD funded amount and its MoM changes.
  
# Total Amount Received:

  Monitor the total amount received from borrowers for assessing cash flow and loan repayments.
  Observe the MTD total received amount and MoM changes.

# Average Interest Rate:

  Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, including MTD data and MoM variations.

  # Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):

  Assess the average DTI of borrowers to understand their financial health, with MTD data and MoM changes.

# Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:

  Good Loans: Good Loan Application Percentage: Percentage of applications classified as 'Good Loans' (loans with 'Fully Paid' or 'Current' status).
  Good Loan Applications: Total number of applications categorized as 'Good Loans'.
  Good Loan Funded Amount: Total funds disbursed for 'Good Loans'.
  Good Loan Total Received Amount: Total payments received for 'Good Loans'.

# Bad Loans:

Bad Loan Application Percentage: Percentage of applications categorized as 'Bad Loans' (loans with 'Charged Off' status).

Bad Loan Applications: Total number of applications categorized as 'Bad Loans'.

Bad Loan Funded Amount: Total funds disbursed for 'Bad Loans'.

Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Total payments received for 'Bad Loans'.

Loan Status Grid View: A comprehensive overview of loans by status, including metrics like 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'MTD Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average DTI.' This report will help in data-driven decision-making and assessing the health of our loan portfolio.

# Dashboard Overview: 
Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Visualize 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received' over time to identify trends.
Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Display lending metrics by state to identify regional lending activity and disparities.
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Show the distribution of loans by term lengths, like 36 months and 60 months.
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Illustrate lending metrics based on borrowers' employment length.
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Breakdown of loan metrics by loan purposes, such as debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Categorize loan metrics by borrowers' home ownership status, such as owning, renting, or having a mortgage.
Details Dashboard: A user-friendly interface providing a comprehensive view of essential loan metrics, borrower profiles, and loan performance. The objective is to offer an efficient way to access detailed loan data.
